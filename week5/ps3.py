# ** Recursive Minimum Finder **

# Problem Statement
# Recursive algorithms are often used to process lists when iteration is restricted.
# You are required to write a Python function as described below.

# * recursive_min(L)

# Input:
# A non-empty list of integers L.

# Output:
# Return the minimum element present in the list.

# Notes:
# The solution must use recursion.
# Loops must NOT be used.
# The built-in min() function must NOT be used.
