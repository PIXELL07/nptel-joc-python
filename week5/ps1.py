# ** Recursive Multiplication Engine **

# Problem Statement

# In embedded systems at RoboLabs, direct multiplication hardware is unavailable. Engineers must rely on recursive logic based on repeated addition to compute products.
# You are required to write a Python function as described below.

# 1. multiply(a, b)
# Input:
# Two non-negative integers a and b.

# Output:
# Return the product a × b.

# Notes:

# The computation must be done using recursion.
# Only addition and subtraction may be used.
# Loops (for, while) must NOT be used.
# The * operator must NOT be used.
